# Defending against password-cracking

Password cracking can very effectively be defended against using (a combination of) the following techniques

## Users can adopt:
* Unique passwords
* Long passwords
* Complex passwords
* Password-managers (as explained by [Mary Poppins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgCHcuCw_RQ))
  * Choosing a password-manager can be [tricky](https://www.securityevaluators.com/casestudies/password-manager-hacking/) as these don't guarantee 100% safety, though nothing will. I do want to stress that using any password-manager (listed in the article) gives far more security than reuse or otherwise predictable passwords.

See my article for users (Dutch) [here](../publications/2018-02-08_passwords_myths_errors_tip_for_users/README.md)

## Developers can adopt:
* Proper hashing (bcrypt)
* Proper encryption (using hardened algorithms)
* Dynamic & static salting
* 2FA / MFA
* Account lockout (temporary, after failed logins)

See my article for developers (Dutch) [part 1](../publications/2018-02-21_passwords_myths_errors_tips_for_devs_1/README.md) and [part 2](../publications/2018-02-08_passwords_myths_errors_tip_for_users/README.md)

## Rigorous defense:
* Disallow all cracked passwords (eg. using Troy Hunt's [Pwnd Passwords API](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2) )
* Disallow common password patterns as discussed in [this](https://youtu.be/zUM7i8fsf0g?t=982) talk on password cracking
