-- Notes --

* Secure Design is important
  * Perform Secure design review
* This is true with software development as well
  * Think about how your system is going to be used
  * Think how it can be abused
  * Design accordingly
  * This is called Threat modelling

-- Notes --

* Don't blame people when they fail on Security
  * Help and educate instead
  * See how you can improve on teaching
  * Reward ppl for doing the right thing
* We all have company badges:
  * All employees can check for badges, when company policy is to wear them visibly
  * Be helpful and friendly, malicious ppl will reveal themselves soon enough
  * Spot that "lost visitor" and help them to front-desk for a visitor badge
